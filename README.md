#Hello World

Hi mankinds!

my name is Mehdi Hamidi, I born on Feb, 7, 1992, in Iran, Kordestan, Saqqez city, and when I was  3 years old, we migrated to Karaj that now it is a capital for itself.


I'm glad to join to this community(GitHub) and hope to learn helpful things here.

Honestly, I'm newbie in web programming and just heared that github is a useful tool for this field and just joined here.

at the end I'm thankful and say goodbye to you :).
